# Project: AI Food Debate – Pizza Agent vs. Sushi Agent using AutoGen Framework

## Description:

Developed an AI-driven multi-agent system using the AutoGen framework to evaluate the health benefits of different food choices. The project involved designing two autonomous agents—Pizza Agent and Sushi Agent—each programmed to advocate for their respective food items based on nutritional values, ingredients, and health impact. A Judge Agent was implemented to analyze arguments and decide which option is healthier based on predefined health metrics.

## Key Responsibilities:

* Designed and implemented Pizza Agent and Sushi Agent to present arguments using AI reasoning and factual data.

* Developed a Judge Agent capable of evaluating arguments and making decisions using predefined health criteria.

* Integrated AutoGen framework for multi-agent communication and structured debate.

* Applied LLM-based decision-making to ensure logical and data-backed reasoning.

* Optimized agent workflows to improve response time and adaptability.

* Tested and validated the system with different datasets, ensuring fair and unbiased decision-making.

## Technologies Used:

* AutoGen Framework for multi-agent AI interactions

* Large Language Models (LLMs) for argument generation and decision-making

* Python (LLM-based development) for AI model integration

* Data Processing & Nutrition Analysis for evaluating food health metrics

## Outcome:
Successfully developed an AI-driven food debate system that showcases multi-agent collaboration in a real-world decision-making scenario. The project demonstrates how AI agents can autonomously analyze, debate, and provide intelligent judgments based on structured data and reasoning.
